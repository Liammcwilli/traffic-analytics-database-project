# Project Instructions

## Traffic Analytics
In this project you’ll use what you’ve learned about database maintenance to manage a table that receives constant updates from a network of sensors.

Imagine that your company provides information about vehicle traffic around it’s retail locations. After anyone passes by one of your company’s cameras, an observation is created with the time, location, time spent in the observation area (in seconds), and their distance traveled in the observation area (in meters). To start, we’ll have a single table in the database named sensors.observations with the following format.

# Conclusion
This PostgreSQL project taught me a lot about managing table sizes and optimizing space. I learned how data operations like updates, inserts, and deletions impact disk usage. Vacuuming and truncating were effective in controlling table bloat and freeing up space. Importing data showed how inserts expand table size, while different commands affect the database footprint. Overall, it emphasized the importance of regular maintenance for efficient database management.
